# üìä Correlation vs Regression

> **"Correlation does NOT imply causation."**

---

## üîó What is Correlation?

- Correlation measures how **strongly two variables move together**.
- It does **not** show **cause and effect**.
- Example:  
  If study hours increase and grades increase, they are **correlated**,  
  but we can't say **studying causes better grades** just from correlation.

### ‚ûï Key Properties:
- Works **both ways**:  
  Correlation between `X and Y` = Correlation between `Y and X`.
- Output is a **single number** (e.g., `0.8`, `-0.6`), showing strength and direction.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What is Regression?

- Regression shows how **one variable affects another**.
- It's all about **causality** ‚Äì cause and effect.
- Example:  
  More years of education ‚Üí Higher income ‚úÖ  
  Income ‚Üí More years of education ‚ùå (not usually true)

### ‚ûï Key Properties:
- Shows **cause and effect** (not just association).
- Output is a **line**:  
  e.g., `Y = B0 + B1 * X`
- Regression of `Y on X` is **not** the same as `X on Y`.

## üìä Visual Difference

| Feature        | Correlation                  | Regression                          |
|----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| What it shows  | Strength of connection       | Cause and effect                     |
| Direction      | Symmetric (X to Y = Y to X)  | One-way (X causes Y)                |
| Output         | A single value (e.g., 0.8)    | A line equation (e.g., Y = mX + c)  |
| Use Case       | Check if variables relate    | Predict or explain one variable     |
| Graph Type     | Scatter plot                 | Best-fit line                       |

## üí° Simple Analogy

Imagine two people walk into a room together every day:
- **Correlation** says: "They seem to show up at the same time!"
- **Regression** asks: "Is one bringing the other to the room?"

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Correlation is for finding **relationships**.
- Regression is for making **predictions** or explaining **why** one variable changes.

üß† **Remember**:  
Just because two things are related doesn‚Äôt mean one causes the other!
