Regression Analysis

### 💡 What is Regression?

* Regression is a **way to make predictions**.
* You use it when **one thing depends on another**.

  * Example:

    * The more money you earn → the more money you spend.
    * The more time you study → the better you perform.
* Regression helps you **find and understand** that kind of relationship.

### 🧠 Why is Regression Important?

* It's one of the **main tools** in data science to **predict things**.
* It helps companies and researchers answer questions like:

  * “If I increase price, will sales go down?”
  * “Does temperature affect electricity use?”
* **Used a lot in jobs, projects, and research**.

### 🤖 Where Do We Use It?

* **Machine Learning**: Many models (like predicting house prices, sales, etc.) start with regression.
* **Business**: Forecasting future trends.
* **Research**: Understanding cause-effect relationships.

### 🛠️ What Will You Learn in This Lesson?

* Step-by-step you’ll learn:

  1. **Simple Regression**: One input → one output.
     *(e.g., hours studied → test score)*
  2. **Multiple Regression**: Many inputs → one output.
     *(e.g., hours studied + sleep + attendance → test score)*
  3. How to:

     * Build a regression model (in Python)
     * Read the results (understand what it’s saying)
     * Compare models to see which one is better

### 📌 Summary (To Remember Easily):

* **Regression = Prediction + Relationship**
  Use it when you want to **predict** something based on another thing.
* It’s a **must-know** skill in data science and machine learning.
* You’ll learn **how to build, read, and use** regression in real-life situations.

### 🧠 One Line to Always Remember:

> **"Regression shows how one thing affects another — and helps you predict what might happen next."**
